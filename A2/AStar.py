"""
Contains the standard A* algorithm implementation.

AStar takes the following input:
start_state:                        The state of the first node.
func_heuristic(state):              Function for estimating the remainding cost for a path from the given state to the goal.
func_adjacent_states(state):         Function for generating the successing nodes for a given state.
func_goal_evaluate(state):          Function returns True if the state is the goal, else False.
func_cost(state, next_state):       Function returning the cost of going from one state to another. Set to 1 by default.

Behavour:
Only run() should be called. It returns a path of nodes.
